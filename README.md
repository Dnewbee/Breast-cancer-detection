## üìå Overview  
This project is designed to run on **Google Colab**.  
It requires downloading pre-trained model weights from Google Drive and setting up the **Kaggle API** to access datasets.

## üöÄ Getting Started  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Open in Google Colab  
You can open this project in Google Colab by uploading the notebook   

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Download Model Weights  
The pre-trained model weights are hosted on Google Drive.  
You will need to download them into your Colab environment using the provided Google Drive link.  

**Google Drive Link for Weights:**

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Kaggle API  
To access datasets from Kaggle, you need to configure the Kaggle API.  

**Steps:**  
1. Go to your Kaggle Account Settings page.  
2. Scroll down to the API section and click **Create New API Token**.  
3. A file named `kaggle.json` will be downloaded to your system.  
4. Upload this file to your Colab environment.  
5. Move the uploaded file to the `.kaggle` directory inside your Colab environment.  
6. Ensure the file permissions are set correctly.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Project  
Once the setup is complete:  
- Open the notebook in Colab.  
- Make sure the model weights and Kaggle API are correctly set up.  
- Run the notebook cells step by step to train or evaluate the model.
